		<h1> Lurics </h1>
		I've paid my dues<br>
		Time after time<br>
		I've done my sentence<br>
		But committed no crime<br>
		And bad mistakes<br>
		I've made a few<br>
		I've had my share of sand<br>
		Kicked in my face<br>
		But I've come through<br>
		And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>
		We are the champions, my friends<br>
		And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
		We are the shampions<br>
		We are the champions<br>
		No time for losers<br>
		'Cause we are the champions of the World<br>
		<br>
		I've taken my bows<br>
		And my curtain calls<br>
		You brought me fame and fortune<br>
		And everything that goes with it<br>
		I thank you all<br>
		But it's been no bed of roses<br>
		No pleasure cruise<br>
		I consider it a challenge before<br>
		the human race<br>
		And I ain't gonna lose<br>
		And we mean to go on and on and on and on<br>
		We are the champions, my friends<br>
		And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
		We are the champions<br>
		We are the champions<br>
		No time for losers<br>
		'Cause we are the champions of the World<br>
		<br>
		We are the champions, my friends<br>
		And we'll keep on fighting till the end<br>
		We are the shampions<br>
		We are the champions<br>
		No time for losers<br>
		'Cause we are the champions of the World<br>
